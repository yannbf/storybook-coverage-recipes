# Agular + Vite

- [Open in stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/yannbf/storybook-coverage-recipes/tree/main/angular_vite?preset=node)

This project was generated with [Analog](https://npmjs.com/package/create-analog), and you can see the original template [here](https://github.com/brandonroberts/angular-analog-storybook-vite).

## Setting up coverage

Install `vite-plugin-istanbul` and register it in your `.storybook/main.js` file.
Optionally, use defaults from `@storybook/addon-coverage/dist/cjs/constants` so you can exclude files.

```js
// .storybook/main.js
const { mergeConfig } = require('vite');
const angular = require('@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular');
const istanbul = require('vite-plugin-istanbul');
// get default config from addon-coverage â€“ no need to register it
const constants = require('@storybook/addon-coverage/dist/cjs/constants');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  async viteFinal(config) {
    // return the customized config
    return mergeConfig(config, {
      root: 'src',
      publicDir: 'assets',
      resolve: {
        mainFields: ['module'],
      },
      plugins: [
        angular.default(),
        istanbul({
          exclude: constants.defaultExclude,
          extension: constants.defaultExtensions
        })],
    });
  },
}
```

Once you've done that, you should check whether the instrumentation is happening correctly. To do so:

1. Open your Storybook
2. Open developer tools
3. Select the `storybook-preview-iframe` as a target
4. Type `__coverage__` and see if it evaluates to an object containing information about your components. If it does, then you're good to go!

## Generating coverage

You will need to have the `@storybook/test-runner` installed. The test runner visits a running Storybook, so you will have to run Storybook and after that, execute the test runner with the `--coverage` flag enabled:

```sh
yarn storybook
```
then

```sh
yarn test-storybook --coverage
```

As a result, you should see the report in the CLI:

If you want to generate an interactive reporter, you can then run:

```sh
npx nyc report --reporter html coverage/storybook --report-dir coverage/storybook
```

And open the `index.html` file inside of the `coverage/storybook` folder.
