# react-vite

- [Open in stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/yannbf/storybook-coverage-recipes/tree/main/react_vite?preset=node)

## Setting up coverage

Install `vite-plugin-istanbul` and register it in your `.storybook/main.js` file.
Optionally, use defaults from `@storybook/addon-coverage/dist/cjs/constants` so you can exclude files.

```js
// .storybook/main.js
const istanbul = require('vite-plugin-istanbul');
// get default config from addon-coverage â€“ no need to register it
const constants = require('@storybook/addon-coverage/dist/cjs/constants');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  async viteFinal(config) {
    config.plugins.push(istanbul({
      exclude: constants.defaultExclude,
      extension: constants.defaultExtensions
    }));
    // customize the Vite config here
    return config;
  },
}
```

Once you've done that, you should check whether the instrumentation is happening correctly. To do so:

1 - Open your Storybook
2 - Open developer tools
3 - Select the `storybook-preview-iframe` as a target
4 - Type `__coverage__` and see if it evaluates to an object containing information about your components. If it does, then you're good to go!

## Generating coverage

You will need to have the `@storybook/test-runner` installed. After that, just run the following command:

```sh
yarn test-storybook --coverage
```
