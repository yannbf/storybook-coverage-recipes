# Storybook Coverage Recipes

This repository serves as an example of projects using the Storybook test runner (`@storybook/test-runner`) to generate code coverage for the components that render in Storybook, as well as the necessary steps to setup the coverage correctly, which may vary between projects of different frameworks and builders (Webpack, Vite).
